# OpenGL demo

## Description
&ensp;&ensp; openGL demos while learning it. Some are from the 'step by step' tutorial on the website. Others are from the books 'OpenGL superbible 4th'.  
&ensp;&ensp; However, in my VM ubuntu16.04, the 'step by step' tutorial codes cannot work properly, but the book's codes work well.  
  
&ensp;&ensp; Codes that ***don't*** work in my VM: 
- `dot.cpp`
- `triangle.cpp`
- `triColor.cpp`  

&ensp;&ensp; Codes in the book that ***do*** work in my VM:  
&ensp;&ensp; Note that the number prefix is the chapter and section in the book.
- `2_4_rectangle.cpp`
- `2_5_rectMove.cpp`
- `3_4_3dPaintPad.cpp`

## Notes
&ensp;&ensp; In my VM Ubuntu16.04, ***`glLineWidth()`*** does not work. The line range is [1.0,1.0] according to function *`glGetFloatv()`*. However, this function works in actual machine and the line range is [1.0,7.375].
